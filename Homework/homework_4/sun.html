    <p>The Sun is the star at the centre of the Solar System. It is a massive, nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma,
        heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy from its surface mainly as
        visible light and infrared radiation with 10% at ultraviolet energies. It is by far the most important source of
        energy for life on Earth. The Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures. It has been a central
        subject for astronomical research since antiquity.</p>
